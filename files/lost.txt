I'm an ordinary man, Jack, meat and potatoes, I live in the real world. I'm not a big believer in magic. But this place is different. It's special. 
The others don't want to talk about it because it scares them. But we all know it. We all feel it. 
Is your white rabbit a hallucination? Probably. But what if everything that happened here, happened for a reason? What if this person that you're chasing is really here? Even if it's impossible, let's say it's not.
I don't know. But I've looked into the eye of this Island. And what I saw was beautiful.
